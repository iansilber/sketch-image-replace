# Image Replace for Sketch

[Download Sketch Image Replacer](https://github.com/iansilber/sketch-image-replace/archive/master.zip)

A quick way to replace one or more vector shapes with an image from a directory of your choosing.

This plugin was derived from Content Generator. The main difference is that with Image Replace, images can be stored anywhere on your computer, as opposed to having to be stored in the plugin directory.

This plugin has three commands:

* **Replace (shift + cmd + i):** Fills selected shapes with images from a folder you choose. After choosing the first time, it won't ask again. Reset it using the Settings command.
* **Choose Manually (Ctrl + shift + cmd + i):** Same as above but lets you choose the folder each time
* **Reset Default Directory:** change the directory used for the Replace command
